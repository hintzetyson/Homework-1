# Code Refactor

In this project, I refactored some code for Horiseon. I made sure they had semantic HTML elements, including nav and main, as well as alt tags for accessibility. I changed the headings and other settings to ensure they were in a reasonable order, as well as the title of the web page.

I also edited the CSS pages as well to cut down on the amount of code needed and grouped up similar formatting, creating tags that allowed for concise and repeatable code.
